	<ul>
		<li> Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. </li>
		<li> The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission. </li>
		<li> The average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks. </li> 
		<li> The first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests, but the most recent outbreak in west Africa 
				has involved major urban as well as rural areas. </li>
		<li> Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks. Good outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, namely 
				case management, surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service, safe burials and social mobilisation.</li> 
        <li> Early supportive care with rehydration, symptomatic treatment improves survival. There is as yet no licensed treatment proven to neutralise 
				the virus but a range of blood, immunological and drug therapies are under development.</li>
		<li> There are currently no licensed Ebola vaccines but 2 potential candidates are undergoing evaluation. </li>

	<p>
	It is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts. Ebola is introduced into the human population 
	through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, 
	monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest.Ebola then spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact
	(through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials 
    (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.Health-care workers have frequently been infected while treating patients with suspected or 
	confirmed EVD. This has occurred through close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practised.
	Burial ceremonies in which mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased person can also play a role in the transmission of Ebola.
	People remain infectious as long as their blood and body fluids, including semen and breast milk, contain the virus. Men who have recovered from the 
	disease can still transmit the virus through their semen for up to 7 weeks after recovery from illness.

	<div data-role="main" class="ui-content">
	<p>
	The incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms is 2 to 21 days. Humans are not infectious until they
	develop symptoms. First symptoms are the sudden onset of fever fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, 
	rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding (e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the 
	stools). Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes.

	<div data-role="main" class="ui-content">
	<p>
	It can be difficult to distinguish EVD from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. Confirmation that symptoms are caused
	by Ebola virus infection are made using the following investigations:
	<ul>
		<li> antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </li> 
		<li> antigen-capture detection tests</li> 
		<li> serum neutralization test</li> 
		<li> reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay</li> 
		<li> electron microscopy</li> 
		<li> virus isolation by cell culture.</li> 
	</ul>
	Samples from patients are an extreme biohazard risk; laboratory testing on non-inactivated samples should be conducted under maximum biological 
	containment conditions.

	Supportive care-rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids- and treatment of specific symptoms, improves survival. There is as yet no proven treatment

	No licensed vaccines are available yet, but 2 potential vaccines are undergoing human safety testing.

	Good outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, namely case management, surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service, 
	safe burials and social mobilisation. Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for Ebola 
	infection and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. Risk reduction messaging should focus on 
	several factors:
	<ul>
		<li> <b> Reducing the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission </b> from contact with infected fruit bats or monkeys/apes and the consumption of their 
			raw meat. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing. Animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly 
			cooked before consumption.</li> 
		<li> <b> Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission </b> from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their
			bodily fluids. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing is 
			required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home. </li> 
		<li> <b> Outbreak containment measures </b>  including prompt and safe burial of the dead, identifying people who may have been in contact 
			with someone infected with Ebola, monitoring the health of contacts for 21 days, the importance of separating the healthy from the sick to 
			prevent further spread, the importance of good hygiene and maintaining a clean environment.</li>
